``python3 -m unittest``
or 
``python -m unittest``


# Todo

1. Some graphs of simulations, and maybe 2D location stuff
2. Prove:
	a. That the exponential sampling dist is best response
	b. That the exponential sampling dist is a corr equilibria
3. Think about:
	a. What Bayesian interp means given this particular strat
